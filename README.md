# Hashtable

This is a simple implementation of a separate chaining with list head cells and
fast enumeration [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), with
an option for incremental resizing.

The hashtable is selfcontained in [hashtable.c](hashtable.c) and 
[hashtable.h](hashtable.h). Other files are just test programs.
